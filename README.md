## 🔧 Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Angular CLI

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamko034/running-tools.git
cd running-tools
npm install
```

### Development Server

```bash
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` for local development.

### Build

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
